        <h2>Welcome</h2>

        <p>
            Hi, I graduated from Northeastern University's Master's of Science
            in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity program in May, 2018 and
            currently working as a Senior Web Application Developer at
            The MITRE Corporation in Bedford, MA. Prior to starting full-time at
            MITRE, I completed two undergraduate Co-ops and two graduate
            internships at MITRE, an undergraduate Co-op at EMC Corporation in
            Franklin, MA, and two summer internships at with the U.S. Navy in
            Newport, RI.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my current role at MITRE, I have the opportunity to improve user
            experience by delivering a variety of internal applications which
            allow MITRE employees easy access to information regarding people,
            projects, and other information relevant to MITRE's mission. I
            continuously seek opportunities to identify security weaknesses in
            our web applications, configuration scripts, and processes in an
            effort to improve my team's security posture.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to my work responsibilities, I also maintain several
            open-source NodeJS modules on the Node Package Manager (NPM).
            Through these modules and my use of other open-source modules on
            NPM, I've become somewhat active in the open source community. I
            believe that it's not only an excellent way to improve the
            reusability of code, but it's also a way to give back to the
            open-source software community.
        </p>

        <p>
            Prior to earning my Master's Degree, I earned my Bachelor's Degree
            in Computer Science and Information Science (Dual Major) from
            Northeastern University in May, 2016. While working towards my
            Bachelor's degree, I completed my first Co-op at EMC Corporation in
            August 2013. I was very excited to be able to work for a company
            and gain valuable experience. It was a great experience and I
            learned a lot at EMC. The initial job responsibilities included
            Time to Failure (TTF) testing on hard and solid state drives. When
            I noticed there was a possibility of improving the process utilized
            in running these tests, I explored those alternatives and presented
            my work to my co-workers. They were thoroughly impressed and
            eventually expanded my job responsibilities to include multiple
            additional programming responsibilities. If you would like to see
            some of the projects that I worked on at EMC, please look at my
            resume. It was a great experience to work for and be part of such
            an innovative company. For my second Co-op, I accepted an offer at
            MITRE Corporation. During that Co-op, I gained experience with a
            number of new technologies, including AngularJS, NodeJS,
            agile software development, and even lead my team's daily stand-up
            meetings. My third Co-op, which was my second Co-op at MITRE,
            provided me with additional responsibilities and allowed me to get
            more experience with leading a small Co-op project, which is now
            used daily by the majority of MITRE's employees.
