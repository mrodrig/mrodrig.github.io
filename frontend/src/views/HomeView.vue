        <p>
            Hi, I graduated from Northeastern University's Master's of Science in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity program in May, 2018 and began working as a Senior Web Application Developer at The MITRE Corporation in Bedford, MA. Shortly after starting, I started assisting the mobile development team within the department I was working in on MITRE@Work, the company's largest employee-focused mobile app. In 2020, I accepted a new role as Lead Mobile Architect and Web Applications Developer where I was tasked with architecting innovative solutions for both mobile and web applications, typically leveraging cloud solutions.

            Most recently, I accepted a new position in April 2023 within the same department at MITRE as one of two department-wide architects and software engineers. In my latest role, I regularly work across the teams in the department to identify model architectures for applications as we progressively shift workloads to the cloud and collaborate with developers to help identify innovative solutions to challenges. Additionally, I work in conjunction with the other department-wide architect to ensure we're working towards building efficient, effective, and scalable software that will achieve MITRE's mission as we shift to the cloud. Effectively, this position allows me to have a larger impact on the entire division's direction by leading development across the full stack, and collaborating with division management to deliver critical capabilities to MITREâ€™s global employees, sponsors, and partners.

            In addition to my regular responsibilities, cybersecurity is a subject that I'm extremely passionate about and something that I always incorporate in my work. Whether I'm designing a new cloud application architecture, writing code for a new project, or reviewing merge requests from colleagues, I continuously seek opportunities to identify security weaknesses in an effort to improve my team and department's security posture.

            Outside of work, I also maintain several open-source NodeJS modules on the Node Package Manager (NPM). Through these modules and my use of other open-source modules on NPM, I've become somewhat active in the open source community. I believe that it's not only an excellent way to improve the reusability of code, but it's also a way to give back to the open-source software community.

            Prior to earning my Master's Degree, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Information Science (Dual Major) from Northeastern University in May, 2016. While working towards my Bachelor's degree, I completed my first Co-op at EMC Corporation in August 2013. I was very excited to be able to work for a company and gain valuable experience. It was a great experience and I learned a lot at EMC. The initial job responsibilities included Time to Failure (TTF) testing on hard and solid state drives. When I noticed there was a possibility of improving the process utilized in running these tests, I explored those alternatives and presented my work to my co-workers. They were thoroughly impressed and eventually expanded my job responsibilities to include multiple additional programming responsibilities. If you would like to see some of the projects that I worked on at EMC, please look at my resume. It was a great experience to work for and be part of such an innovative company. For my second Co-op, I accepted an offer at MITRE Corporation. During that Co-op, I gained experience with a number of new technologies, including AngularJS, NodeJS, agile software development, and even lead my team's daily stand-up meetings. My third Co-op, which was my second Co-op at MITRE, provided me with additional responsibilities and allowed me to get more experience with leading a small Co-op project, which became an application that was used daily by the majority of MITRE's employees.
