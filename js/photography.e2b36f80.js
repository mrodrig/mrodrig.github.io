My parents ended up purchasing me my first DSLR camera - a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi with an 18-55mm and 75-300mm lens. I took well over 20,000 photos with that camera and it went practically everywhere.

Upon researching the cameras on the market, I decided on a Canon EOS Rebel T5i with an 18-55mm lens. I later purchased a 50mm macro lens to use with it as well. Again, I took over 20,000 photos with it. Many of those photos were taken at various car shows and cruise nights that I participated in.

In the first year of ownership, I have already taken several thousand photos with it and look forward to taking thousands more!
